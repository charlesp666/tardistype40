 Leapfrog solitaire is played on a tableau of four rows of thirteen cards or blank spaces. The tableau is setup by dealing out a standard, shuffled deck of 52 cards into the four rows of thirteen cards each. The aces are then removed to create the "play-spaces." 

 The object of the game is to move cards into these play-spaces so that the suits are in descending, sorted order beginning with the King in the left-most column. Clicking on a play-space moves the card next in descending sequence to the card on the left-side of the play-space. Clicking on a play-space in the Kings' column (the left-most column) prompts to select which King to move to that position.

 The game ends when either no more plays can be made (all four play-spaces are next to deuces or another play-space), or all four suits are in correct sequence. If this is the case, the four empty play-spaces should be found in the right-most column of each row.

 The player wins the game if all four suits are in correct sequence with the King located in the left-most column of the row. The order of the suits is immaterial.

 Scoring is as follows:

 - 2 points are awarded for each card that is found in proper sequence;
 - 5 points are awarded for each card found in correct position;
 - 10 points are awarded for each completed suit;
 - A 400 point bonus, or four times the buy-in (100), is awarded if the player wins the game.

 When the game ends a summary of the player's current score, for the current game and accumulated score, will be displayed.

 The buy-in of 100 points is deducted from the score at the end of each game. For this reason it is possible for a player to have a negative amount for winnings, but don't worry, your computer will not contact the mob, and men who like to break legs will not appear at your door.

 To start a new game select the "New Game" option under the "Game" menu. To view player winnings (except for current game) select the "Statistics" option under the "Game" menu.

Good Luck!
